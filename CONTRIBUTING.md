## Who can contribute?
OpenRW is a community driven project, we are open to contributions from anyone
who cares to submit a pull request. Members of the community can provide their
input on reviewing open pull requests to make sure the changes work for them.
Once a pull request has been vetted, a member with the appropriate rights will
accept it into the code base.

GitHub moderation privileges may be granted to active contributors who display a
good ability to moderate in their issues and pull requests.

## See what's happening
Make sure to drop into the IRC channel #openrw on chat.freenode.net for discussion
about features in development.

## How to contribute
If you can write source code to implement missing features or fix bugs, changes
can be submitted for review via GitHub's pull requests system.

If you aren't able to contribute source code, we are also happy to see improved
documentation of the expected behaviour on sites like the gtamodding wiki.
Improving this documentation makes it easier to implement the correct behaviour.

## Submitting Pull Requests

If you are submitting a pull request for OpenRW:

1. Include a reference to any issue the pull request is intended to address.
2. Submit unrelated changes in different pull requests.
3. If you aren't ready to merge your changes but are looking for feedback, include "[not ready]" in the title.
4. Changes in behaviour should be shown to match the behaviour in the original game, if applicable.
5. Ensure that the test suite still passes after your change, updating tests if required.

## Guidelines
### What will be accepted
* Changes that increase compatibility with the game data.
* Fixes for technical issues, such as wide-screen or UHD resolution support.
* Feature enhancements, such as improved support for different input schemes.

### What will not be accepted
* Changes where the ownership of the code is in question.
* Changes to support non-GTA titles.

## Evaluating pull requests
Pull requests should be reviewed by as many people as possible for merging.
Ideally at least two active contributors should review the changes before it is
accepted, including the person who will accept the pull request.

# OpenRW

A project to re-implement gta3.exe, adding support for more platforms and fixing all of the bugs that have piled up.

**REQURIES A LEGITAMATE COPY OF GTA III PC TO RUN**, this project only functions with the original game's data.

## Building

Dependencies:

* Bullet
* GLM (0.9.5+)
* SFML (2.0+)

Options:

* BUILD\_OLD\_TOOLS â€“ Builds old, unmaintained tools (datadump & analyzer)

## Running

### rwgame

Implementation of the game itself.

* Options:
    * env: OPENRW\_GAME\_PATH, must be set to the folder containing "gta3.exe"
    * -w **n**, -h **n** sets initial window size

### rwviewer

File viewer for game data, open the folder containing "gta3.exe" and it will load the data.

Currently only supports viewing instance data, pending some rewriting.

## Things to do

* Make it work on Windows (shouldn't be too difficult for anyone with CMake and C++ experience)
* Write FindSFML and FindGLM scripts for cmake.
* Improve the vehicle dynamics
* Add more views to rwviewer
    * Handling data
    * Collision data
    * Animation scrubbing
